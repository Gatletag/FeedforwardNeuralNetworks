# Feedforward Neural Networks

Understanding neural networks with code and no machine learning libraries.

## Requirements

- numpy (`pip install numpy`)

## Perceptron

Making predictions with a perceptron. A perceptron is a single neuron in a neural network. In this example, in order to train the perceptron to make accurate prediction, we require a set of inputs, each with an assoicated output (label). Eg.
```
Input: X = [x1,x2,x3,...,xn]
Output (label): y
```

A perceptron consists of a set of weights to 'map' the input (X) to the output y.
